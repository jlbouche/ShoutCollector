    <p> <i>When misrule takes its place at the eight corners of the world<br>
        When the Brass Tower walks and Time is reshaped<br>
        When the thrice-blessed fail and the Red Tower trembles<br>
        When the Dragonborn Ruler loses his throne, and the White Tower falls<br>
        When the Snow Tower lies sundered, kingless, bleeding<br>
        The World-Eater wakes, and the Wheel turns upon the Last Dragonborn.</i></p>
